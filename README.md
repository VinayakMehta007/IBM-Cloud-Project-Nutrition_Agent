# IBM-Cloud-Project-Nutrition_Agent

# 🧠🥗 AI-Powered Nutrition Agent

An **Agentic AI system** designed to provide **personalized nutritional guidance** through conversational interaction. This digital agent takes into account user-specific details like age, weight, diet preference, and health goals to recommend healthy and balanced meal plans.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Nutrition Agent aims to:

- Act as a **digital nutritionist**.
- Provide **real-time personalized dietary suggestions**.
- Adapt recommendations based on user preferences and changes over time.
- Ensure **health compliance** through conversational feedback.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧬 Personalized meal planning based on input (age, gender, weight, goals)
- 🥦 Nutritional breakdown (calories, macronutrients, vitamins)
- 💬 Natural conversation-based interaction (chat interface)
- 🔁 Adaptive feedback for continuous improvement
- 📊 User progress tracking capabilities
- 🛠️ Modular design for easy integration with external APIs or health systems

---

## 🏗️ System Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- IBM Cloud account and environment (Watson Assistant or IBM Agent Framework)
- VS Code / Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Streamlit (for UI)
- Access to an AI/ML backend (local, cloud-based, or hybrid)
- Stable internet connection

---

## 🔍 Methodology
- Input Gathering: Accepts user data (e.g., age, weight, diet type, allergies).

- Goal Assessment: Maps user inputs to nutritional needs using AI agents.

- Meal Plan Generation: Suggests meals through agent reasoning (rule-based + ML hybrid).

- Real-time Interaction: User can refine goals and get instant feedback.

- Continuous Learning: Adapts suggestions with user feedback and updated health goals.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution 
- Developed an intelligent agent to simulate a virtual nutritionist.

- Designed to handle continuous interaction and adaptive responses.

- System processes user profiles and generates meal recommendations.

- Goal-based planning and iterative improvements via feedback.

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with wearables (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) for real-time health monitoring.

- Expand to multilingual and regional food database support.

- Gamification elements to increase user engagement.

- Grocery shopping integration with local store APIs.

- Collaboration with certified dietitians for hybrid consultations.

- Enhanced data privacy & security compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)
